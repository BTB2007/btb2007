            <h3>Law Student</h3>
            <p>As a third year student at Suffolk Law School, my legal work so far includes
              exposure to legislation, litigation, and transactions.&nbsp;
              <br>
              <br>Prior to law school, I spent four years working in higher education as
              an advisor to undergraduates. During this time I advised student groups
              on issues of organizational management, including issues of mission and
              purpose, goal setting, budgeting, officer transitions, effective meeting
              facilitation, marketing and recruitment, diversity and inclusion, conflict
              resolution, and member accountability. I also advised individual student
              leaders on issues of personal development and leading with integrity. Advising
              took the form of workshops, conferences, classes, service-learning projects
              and one-on-one counseling.
              <br>
              <br>During that time, I developed a strong interest in
              <b>technology</b>and the role modern tools can play in both education, and
              in operational management. In higher education, I helped a non profit build
              and execute a comprehensive e-learning platform. And most recently, I participated
              in a course at law school focused around centering how to use technology
              to advance the legal profession. Take a look below at some of my work product
              that is a result of that course.

            <h3>Jury Deliberation Facilitator</h3>
            <p contenteditable="true">I recently had the opportunity to serve as a juror for a trial. The experience
              was fascinating (for multiple reasons), however I often found myself reflecting
              on how antiquated the operations of a courthouse are. Moreover, during
              deliberations, I became aware of two significant opportunities. First,
              during the trial itself, lawyers reference hundreds upon hundreds of pages
              of evidence. When we arrive in the deliberation room, the court officer
              dumps on the table those hundreds upon hundreds of pages of evidence. If
              we want to find a particular piece of evidence, we would have better luck
              finding a needline in a haystack. But what if juries were provided with
              electronic versions of the evidence? What if each jury room has a simple
              computer attached to a projector that was loaded with all the evidence,
              and a software program that allowed jurors to quickly search the evidence
              for keywords?
              <br>
              <br>Second, during the deliberations, I found that most jurors did not understand
              the concept of "elements" when it relates to legal rules. Not to mention
              that having a judge read you verbatim 300 pages of instructions, is...well,
              ineffective. So what if that same computer in the jury room was loaded
              with a program that would walk jurors through the elements of the crime
              at hand, and guide them through the entire deliberation process? Instead
              of reading 300 pages of instructions in the courtroom, what if the judge
              merely instructed the jury on the process of deliberations, and on the
              relevant standard of doubt? Then, what if the judge dismisses the jury
              to the jury room, where a computer program (that the judge's clerk would
              adapt to the specifics of the particular case) would walk the jurors through
              the actual elements of the crime? &nbsp;And what if that same computer
              system then automatically generated and printed the verdict slip? &nbsp;The
              below link is a sample of what such a application could look like. It uses
              QnA Markup to guide a jury through the deliberations of an intentional
              assault &amp; battery case. &nbsp;
